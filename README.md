# Pollux Political Corpora (PoliCorp) 
Pollux Political Corpora (PoliCorp) is an open resource for accessing and analysing processed political text data serving as an integral part of the [Pollux project](https://www.pollux-fid.de/). PoliCorp offers researchers structured and searchable access to extensive textual datasets, facilitating in-depth analysis of parliamentary discourse across time. Based on PoliCorp, researchers can easily generate sub-corpora for individual research.

A demo version is available [here](https://demo-pollux.gesis.org/).

Currently, the platform hosts data from the [GermaParl](https://github.com/PolMine/GermaParlTEI)  corpus, a comprehensive linguistic dataset curated by the [PolMine](https://polmine.github.io/)  project. GermaParl is a collection of the official protocols of plenary debates published by the German Bundestag, spanning 72 years of parliamentary discourse â€“ from September 7, 1949, to September 7, 2021, and comprises 958,100 speech contributions.
We offer political scientists and multidisciplinary researchers access to structured data that is easily searchable through the web search interface. With the advanced search functionality, researchers can apply logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT to combine or exclude search criteria, making it easier to filter through vast amounts of parliamentary debate data. The search can be customised by combining multiple fields and applying logical operators to uncover intricate patterns and insights within the data. Selected datasets can be downloaded freely in JSON format, providing a convenient option for further analysis using computational tools.
